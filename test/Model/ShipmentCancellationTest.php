/**
 * Logistics API
 *
 * The <b>Logistics API</b> resources offer the following capabilities: <ul><li><b>shipping_quote</b> &ndash; Consolidates into a list a set of live shipping rates, or quotes, from which you can select a rate to ship a package.</li> <li><b>shipment</b> &ndash; Creates a \"shipment\" for the selected shipping rate.</li></ul> Call <b>createShippingQuote</b> to get a list of live shipping rates. The rates returned are all valid for a specific time window and all quoted prices are at eBay-negotiated rates. <br><br>Select one of the live rates and using its associated <b>rateId</b>, create a \"shipment\" for the package by calling <b>createFromShippingQuote</b>. Creating a shipment completes an agreement, and the base service and addition shipping options are totaled into the <b>totalShippingCost</b>. This action also generates a shipping label that you can use to ship the package.<p class=\"tablenote\"><b>Important!</b> Sellers must set up a payment method via their eBay account before they can use the methods in this API to create a shipment and the associated shipping label.</p>
